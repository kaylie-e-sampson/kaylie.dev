            The best collaborative experience I have had has been working with the WISP team at DALI. Before coming to Dartmouth, 
            most of the coding experience I had was individual and self-taught, so being able to work with others on a project that 
            we all design and develop together was exciting. I also canâ€™t describe how grateful I am to work with such amazing, 
            hardworking, passionate people. The other WISPees, mentors, and people I have met along the way have pushed me to do my 
            best, helped me when I needed it, and made me fall more in love with the DALI community. I also enjoyed the way the project
             was split up among all of us. In my opinion, there was just enough time for us to collaborate on how we want the application 
             to look/run even though we all have busy schedules. One thing I would have enjoyed would be more work sessions together. There 
             is something about working in the lab next to others that make it more enjoyable, and I wish I spent more time with my other WISPees 
             in the lab. But other than that, I have only good things to say about my WISP experience at DALI. I have learned that I thrive in the 
             collaborative setting that DALI has set up and would take advantage of the opportunity to continue my time as a DALI member.
