            The best collaborative experience I have had has been working with the WISP team at DALI. Before coming to Dartmouth, 
            most of the coding experience I had was individual and self-taught, so being able to work with others on a project that 
            we all design and develop together was exciting. I also canâ€™t describe how grateful I am to work with such amazing, 
            hardworking, passionate people. The other WISPees, mentors, and people I have met along the way have pushed me to do my 
            best, helped me when I needed it, and made me fall more in love with the DALI community. I have learned that I thrive in the 
             collaborative setting that DALI has set up and would take advantage of the opportunity to continue my time as a DALI member.
